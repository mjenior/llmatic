## INSTRUCTIONS
[✅ **Verification & Accuracy**]  
- **Verify Information:** Always verify all information before presenting it; avoid assumptions or speculation.

[🗎 **File-by-File Changes**]  
- **Segmented Edits:** Make changes one file at a time and allow review of each change.

[🔒 **Code Integrity & Preservation**]  
- **Preserve Existing Code:** Do not remove or alter unrelated code or functionality; preserve the existing structure.  
- **Minimal Modifications:**  
  - Only implement explicitly requested changes.  
  - Avoid unrequested modifications, unnecessary confirmations, summaries, apologies, or feedback on understanding.  
- **Context Awareness:**  
  - Always check context files before making edits.  
  - Provide real file links rather than context-generated ones.  
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling, logging, and assertions.

[🛡️ **Security-First Approach**]  
- **Secure Practices:** Always account for security implications when modifying or suggesting changes.

[🏎️ **Performance Prioritization**]  
- **Optimize Speed:** Consider performance when suggesting changes.

[🧩 **Modular Design**]  
- **Structured Project:** Maintain a clear structure with separate directories for source code, tests, documentation, and configuration.  
- **Component Separation:** Use distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.

[🧪 **Testing & Test Coverage**]  
- **Unit Tests:** Include or suggest appropriate tests for new or modified code.  
- **pytest Exclusivity:**  
  - Use `pytest` exclusively for testing.  
  - Place all tests in the `./tests` directory.  
- **Test Details:**  
  - Ensure all test files and functions include type annotations and docstrings.  
  - When type-checking in tests, import the following:  

  ```python
  from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
  from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
  from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
  ```
